;; The commmand line arguments as given to main() cannot be easily converted to

;; functions that give us access to the raw arguments.

;; I couldn't find a better stop to place these functions. Having them in
;; builtins is wrong because builtins is the very basic types and functions
;; for any xy program and command line arguments is specific to a particular
;; domain. So I plopped them here.

;; Return number of command line arguments
def *argc() -> Int {
    # Implemented by the compiler
}

;; Return raw pointers to the command line arguments
def *argv() -> Ptr~Ptr {
    # Implemented by the compiler
}
